# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Xin Liu

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Take half a day to do this assignment, which takes about almost three days.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Writing codes is getting faster than it used to be. It is also a liitle handy for using classes.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am not very familiar with kivy and GUI applications. Sometimes I know the basic theory but do not know how to use it appropriately in practice.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Some simple basic codes can be run, such as buttons and text input. The use of classes is slightly improved in this assignment.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Doing mor practice on unfamiliar knowledge and get used to it.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
For the GUI program, it is difficult for me to write codes. Therefore, when I am in trouble, I will look up some relevant information on the Internet for reference.
Once I have figured it out, make changes based on the current code.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
When I first started to write GUI program, I felt a little confused about where to start. After reading the question details carefully,
I referred to the slides given by the lecturer and inquired about kivy knowledge and application on the Internet. That is where I found the 
breakthrough.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Before classes was used, all the code was put together in a mess, and usually it is hard to see the connection between variables. After using classes,
all relationships become clear and easy to be corrected.
